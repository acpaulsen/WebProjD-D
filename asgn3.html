      This is a book lover's website. It is meant to be used for personal
      purposes for now, but could be expanded for multi-user use.
    </p>
    <p>Below is the color and text theme I used.</p>

      When you first navigate to the page, you see the landing page, as drawn
      below in Adobe XD.
    </p>

    <p>
      You can look at your dashboard upon logging in (log in would be additional
      build out) This is where you can find statistics about your past reading
      history. I talked to my sister about what she would like to see on the site 
      and her advice was some kind of game portion where simple gmaes can be accessed 
      as she finds that taking a break from reading without going on her phone, youtube or tik tok
      would help her to refocus without rerouting her for too long. 
    </p>

      You may then navigate to the currently reading page to either edit your
      current book's information or log pages/time spent reading.
    </p>
    <img src="MidtermWireframe/CurrentBookLanding.jpeg" />
    <p>From this page you can either log time at the following page</p>
    <img src="MidtermWireframe/LogTime.jpeg" />
    <p>Or you can edit the current book's information</p>
    <img src="MidtermWireframe/EditCurrent.jpeg" />
    <p>
      You can also look back on books you've already read at the library page. I hope to integrate the google books APIhere such that one can click on one of the sware elements and have it automatically take them to the appropriate google books information page.
    </p>

    <p>
      From this page you can either edit books in the Library or view your notes
      from when you read them. The following is the edit page:
    </p>
    <img src="MidtermWireframe/EditBook.jpeg" />
    <p>And this is the reading past notes page:</p>
    <img src="MidtermWireframe/BookNotes.jpeg" />

    <p>Future implementation:</p>
    <p>In the future I would like to hook this up to some kind of databasing service. I integrated lots of JS features (and future features) but potentially connecting this with a SQL powered csv based construct would be helpful to the apps functioning.</p>
