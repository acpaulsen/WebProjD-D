      This is a book lover's website. It is meant to be used for personal
      purposes for now, but could be expanded for multi-user use.
    </p>
    <p>Below is the color and text theme I used.</p>

      When you first navigate to the page, you see the landing page, as drawn
      below in Adobe XD.

      You can look at your dashboard upon logging in (log in would be additional
      build out) This is where you can find statistics about your past reading
      history.

      You may then navigate to the currently reading page to either edit your
      current book's information or log pages/time spent reading.
