    <h1>Assignment One</h1>
    <p>
      For my final project I will be continuing work on my midterm site, hooking
      it up to a database and adding some additional functionality.
    </p>

    <p>
      Some such additional functionalities will be a book search and auto
      population of some information regarding titles. To do this, I will use
      the Google Books API, the documentation of which can be found below:
    </p>

      Google Books API
    </a>

    <p>
      I will also be using some built in JS functionality not in my original
      design to mark things such as date and time of reflections without need of
      user input.
    </p>

    <p>
      I am still working on how to make user authentication and user/password
      databasing work, but I will likely be using Node.js to interact with Mongo
      DB. References can be found at this link:
